        <p class="aboutus-contain" >The Annual Techno-Literary-Management Fest of College of Engineering and
            Technology, Bhubaneswar sees a footfall of more than 4,000 students from across
            the state to participate in brainstorming and inquisitive events spanning over 3 days,
            capping it off with a Star-Night. The Campus has seen the lights of Kenny Sebastian
            and Sapan Verma in 2017 and 2018 respectively. This Year as CET
            students shined in various hackathons and fests across the nation, we decided to bring all those people to our den and
            compete at a higher level.
